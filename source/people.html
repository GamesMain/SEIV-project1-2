        <div class="people_content">
            <h3> Grace Hopper is known as one of the first computer scientists. She joined
                the US Navy during WWII and helped program the Mark I computer. When she helped program
            the Mark II computer, she found a moth stuck inside a component of the computer, thus 
            coining the technical term 'bug' and 'debug'. </h3>

        <button type="button" class="collapse"> Alan Turing</button>
        <div class="people_content">
            <h3> Alan Turing is known for 'the Turing test.' Turing broke ciphers in WWII and he wrote
                of Artificial Intelligence in 1950. The Turing test is a test for intelligence standard in tech
                and is also known as the 'imitation game'.

        <button type="button" class="collapse"> Ada Lovelace</button>
        <div class="people_content">
            <h3> Ada Lovelace is considered 'the world's first computer programmer' at the age
                of 17. She helped Charles Babbage with his analytical engine, which is known to be
                the precursor to the computer. The computer language 'Ada' is in memorial of her. </h3>

        <button type="button" class="collapse"> John Von Neumann</button>
        <div class="people_content">
            <h3> John von Neumann is known for von Neumann architecture. In 1945, von Neumann 
                started working on the EDVAC, one of the earliest electronic computers. He made
                major contributions with this project through the discovery of a way both a program 
                data can be stored in a computers memory. He also is known as the inventor of the merge
                sort algorithm, which is widely used today.
